# Journey Through C++ Smart Pointers

## Introduction
This serves as a place to cement my understanding of C++ and put thoughts down on paper. Knowledge from this article will be sourced from university, forums and documentation. 

## Primer Knowledge
This focuses on smart pointers which assumes you have a decent understanding of C-style pointers, dereferencing and other related information. This information should be sought from other sources but a quick recap will be located here:

### Pointers 

### Dereferencing

### Addresses

## Smart Pointers
Smart pointers are like normal pointers but with additional overhead which makes it harder to mess up and cause leaks. 

However I would never let any good design stop me from doing stupid things.

### Unique Pointers

### Shared Pointers

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Moop204/journey-through-cpp-smart-pointers/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Moop204/journey-through-cpp-smart-pointers/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
